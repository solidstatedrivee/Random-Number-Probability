# Random Number Probability
 A Processing sketch that produces an array of six sorted random numbers in the range of 1-6. The program calculates the chance of choosing these unique numbers at random. I love probability and this was a fun exercise for me!
 
 ## Example output
 >Your random numbers are:
 
 
>3


>3


>4


>4


>5


>6


>There is about a 33% chance of choosing 3 at random


>There is about a 33% chance of choosing 4 at random


>There is about a 17% chance of choosing 5 at random


>There is about a 17% chance of choosing 6 at random
